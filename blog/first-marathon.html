							<h2>Pain, Pride, and a Powerful Lesson in Perseverance</h2>
  
                                <p>Coming off the half marathon earlier in the fall, I felt ready to tackle the full 42.2 kilometers. My training hadn't been perfect, but I was optimistic—and maybe a little naive—about what was to come.</p>
                                
                                <p>I started strong. Too strong, probably. I went out in 1:43 for the first half (I ran a 1:35 in October), cruising through the kilometers, buoyed by energy and adrenaline. For a while, it felt like I had a sub-3:40 finish in the bag.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>And then, at the 39th kilometer, everything changed.</strong></p>
                                
                                <p>A steep uphill section met me with brutal resistance. My legs locked up with cramps—painful, paralyzing, and completely unexpected. I had to walk and stretch them out, trying desperately to will my body forward. I had hit the wall, and the wall hit back.</p>
                                
                                <p>Despite the setback, I crossed the finish line in <strong>3:53</strong>. It wasn't the time I had dreamed of, but most importantly I finished. This experience came with hard-earned lessons.</p>
                                
                                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Train for the Race, Not Just the Distance</strong><br>
                                    Your training plan needs to account for real-world conditions. Weather, course elevation, and your personal schedule all matter. If your winter is brutal, maybe don't sign up for a spring race unless you've got a solid plan B for training.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Nutrition Isn't Optional</strong><br>
                                    I thought 8 Gu gels would have been sufficient nutrition for a Marathon. But, salt pills would've helped prevent cramping. I know that now. Hydration and electrolytes aren't just nice-to-haves. They're essentials. I'll never line up without them again.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Chafing is Real, and It Does Not Care</strong><br>
                                    Vaseline is your best friend. Trust me. Put it on your chest. Put it on your thighs. It'll spare you additional pain.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>The Little Things Add Up</strong><br>
                                    If you're using a bag check, pack wisely: towel, comfy slippers, dry clothes.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Warmth Before the Start is Non-Negotiable</strong><br>
                                    Standing shivering in a start corral isn't ideal. If you don't have throwaway clothes, a trash bag with holes for arms can make a huge difference.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>The Mind is a Muscle, Too</strong><br>
                                    There comes a point in the marathon where your body says, "We're done." That's when your mind has to take over. You have to dig deep, stay focused, and believe you can keep moving. Because you can.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                
                                <h2>What's Next</h2>
                                <p>I'm not stopping here.</p>
                                <p>The goal now is to keep building on my fitness, my strategy, and my experience. I want to chase that elusive sub-3-hour marathon and earn a spot in the world's major races. Long term, these marathons are stepping stones toward something even bigger: completing an Ironman.</p>
                                
                                <p>I ran this race to test myself. I finished it with cramps, pain, and some disappointment—but also with pride, clarity, and a fierce determination to come back stronger.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Here's to the next finish line.</strong></p>
